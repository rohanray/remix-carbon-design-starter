# This is a quick starter template for using [Carbon Design](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) with [React Remix framework](https://remix.run/)

## Features
- Integrated with SCSS
- That's all :)

## Get Started
1. Clone the project
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev:node-sass` in one terminal
4. Run `npm run dev:remix` in another terminal

You can also run `npm run dev` to run node-sass compiler and remix in dev mode together.

## How to SCSS 
Write your SCSS files in `/styles` directory present in the root of the cloned project. The compiled CSS files are then placed inside `/app/styles`

### Caveats
* Issues with variables in SCSS files.
